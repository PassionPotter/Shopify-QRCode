# Scane QR code based product discount Shopify App

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using Node and React. It contains the basics for building a Shopify app.

Rather than cloning this repo, you can use your preferred package manager and the Shopify CLI with [these steps](#installing-the-template).

## Tech Stack

This template combines a number of third party open-source tools:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) builds the backend.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) builds the [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used for routing. We wrap this with file-based routing.
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) queries the Admin API.

The following Shopify tools complement these third-party tools to ease app development:

- [Shopify API library](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) adds OAuth to the Express backend. This lets users install the app and grant scope permissions.
- [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started/using-react) adds authentication to API requests in the frontend and renders components outside of the App’s iFrame.
- [Polaris React](https://polaris.shopify.com/) is a powerful design system and component library that helps developers build high quality, consistent experiences for Shopify merchants.
- [Custom hooks](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/tree/main/hooks) make authenticated requests to the Admin API.
- [File-based routing](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/blob/main/Routes.jsx) makes creating new pages easier.

## Getting started

### Requirements

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
1. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don’t have one.
1. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

### Installing the template

This template can be installed using your preferred package manager:

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn create @shopify/app
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm init @shopify/app@latest
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm create @shopify/app@latest
```

This will clone the template and install the required dependencies.

#### Local Development

[The Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli) connects to an app in your Partners dashboard. It provides environment variables, runs commands in parallel, and updates application URLs for easier development.

You can develop locally using your preferred package manager. Run one of the following commands from the root of your app.

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Open the URL generated in your console. Once you grant permission to the app, you can start development.

## Deployment

### Application Storage

This template uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to store session data. The database is a file called `database.sqlite` which is automatically created in the root. This use of SQLite works in production if your app runs as a single instance.

The database that works best for you depends on the data your app needs and how it is queried. You can run your database of choice on a server yourself or host it with a SaaS company. Here’s a short list of databases providers that provide a free tier to get started:

| Database   | Type             | Hosters                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MySQL      | SQL              | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/managed-databases-mysql), [Planet Scale](https://planetscale.com/), [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql) |
| PostgreSQL | SQL              | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/managed-databases-postgresql), [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres)                                   |
| Redis      | Key-value        | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/managed-databases-redis), [Amazon MemoryDB](https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/)                                                                                                        |
| MongoDB    | NoSQL / Document | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/managed-databases-mongodb), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)                                                                                                  |

To use one of these, you need to change your session storage configuration. To help, here’s a list of [SessionStorage adapter packages](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/tree/main/docs/guides/session-storage.md).

### Build

The frontend is a single page app. It requires the `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, which you can find on the page for your app in your partners dashboard. Paste your app’s key in the command for the package manager of your choice:

Using yarn:

```shell
cd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME yarn build
```

Using npm:

```shell
cd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME npm run build
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
cd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME pnpm run build
```
